# Finance-Forecast
This is the financial forecasting of the Goldman Sach virtual internship where I created the Quantitative financial forecasting using the ad. excel.
It has been created with the concept of design thinking(the product is created keeping the user at the centre)
It was really a great experience because as in engineering sometimes we focus more on the technical stuff rather than solving the real-time business problem. This project includes the basis of Excel but has advanced problem-solving techniques in finance and accounting.
## Purpose of the financial forecasting
* Planning & Budgeting
* Strategic Decision_making
* Resource Allocation
* Performance Evaluation
* Risk Management
* Cash flow Management

## The main forecasting includes the following:
* Glossary
  It includes the financial term which has been used in making the forecasting of the financial model such as Amortization, CapEx, EBITDA, OpEx etc
* Forecast Assumptions
  Project work starts with the assumption of the product sales and average sales price of the product. Here assumption has been made such as Cupcakes, ice cream, and drinks sales has been increasing at a rate of 10 %, with the different assumption of the average price.COGS, OpEX, Depreciation and amortisation (D&A), and Cash Flow are the main metrics taken for the assumption.
* P&L Forecast
  It deals with the forecasting Profit and loss of each item from FY20E-to-Fy24E, with metrics such as Total revenue, Growth %, Gross Profit with Margin, all the operation costs such as staff costs, Occupancy Costs, Marketing Costs, and other costs, D&A, EBIT, EBITA, Net Interest, Profit Before Tax, Net Profit after Tax (NPAT), and Gross Dividends
* Cash Flow Forecast
  This was the most interesting concept I learned through this project, here Cash flow forecast has been done with metrics such as Net cash flow, Debt repayment, Cash to balance sheet, opening cash, cash to the Balance sheet, closing cash, supporting debt schedule with opening debt, debt repayment with the closing debt.
* Outputs
  It is really hard to read the financial sheet so the forecasting has been presented with the charts for easy understanding.
